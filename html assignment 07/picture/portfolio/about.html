                    <q>Time is quite a precious commodity. One should exercise minimum care in utilizing one’s time. I have learned throughout all the years of my life, the good value of time and discipline. I love having the time management, sound strategy and clear cut goals in the life.

    I love time management and discipline in life. I have learned all of these value from my mother. My Mother is my true inspiration. He has groomed me like himself. I am quite inspired by him and that has been the single aim of my life to serve the people selflessly, as my Mother does. <br><br/><br/>
    
    I love to read books that describe the rich history and civilization of ancient Pakistan. Apart from history, I love to read the novels of Shakespeare. Though I am rarely free from my routine works. But whenever I am free I love playing luddo game with my friends. I have been the top scorer in this game, in fact. <br/><br/><br/>
    
    I have a little interest in online gaming. I rarely use my personal computer and Mobile device for games. I love to value my time for the good of my future. Friends are the best mirrors of a person. In fact, the circle of friends you chose to stay with, does define your personality and priorities. I am fortunate enough to have the best ever friends in my company.<br/><br/><br/>
    
    My life is full of experiments and achievements. I have got success many times and many times I have failed also. This all has truly taught me the importance of rising again and strike again. I continue to update myself to be the better version of myself. Although no one can be described in a few set of sentences. One need to have though command of oneself before going to write something about his life. That’s to say my life has become what is, an essence of all of my achievements and struggles.
